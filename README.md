BeCode team exercise


You find yourself in a dark room with no windows and a _soft light_ comming from the only working neon....
Try to figure out where you are...
      but mainly....
            try to **escape the danger**,
##                       find your way out !

You look around, there are no windows. You are sitting on a bed across a door. A door that seems to be the only 
connection to the outside world. The desk in the opposite side of the bed has no chair, it is illuminated by the neon 
light, which is hanging above it half-dead.
